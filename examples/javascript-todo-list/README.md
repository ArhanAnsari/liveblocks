# Multiplayer to-do list app with [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io)

This project shows how to build a real-time to-do list that do not rely on any front-end technologies. It uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for the bundling.

## Getting started

### Run examples locally

- Install all dependencies with `npm install`

- Create an account on [liveblocks.io](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard)

- Copy your public key from the [administration](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/apikeys)

- Replace `pk_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` with your own public key.

- Run `npm build` and open `static/index.html`
